Octave is used interactively by running the program 'octave' without any arguments. Once started, Octave reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit.

You can use exit(0) function to come out of the Octave prompt. 

There are following important commands to start with Octave command prompt:

C-b  -- Move back one character.
C-f -- Move forward one character.
DEL -- Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
C-d -- Delete the character underneath the cursor.
M-f -- Move forward a word.
M-b -- Move backward a word.
C-a -- Move to the start of the line.
C-e --  Move to the end of the line.
C-l -- Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.
C-_
C-/ -- Undo the last thing that you did. You can undo all the way back to an empty line.
M-r -- Undo all changes made to this line. This is like typing the `undo' command enough times to get back to the beginning.
C-k -- Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.
M-d -- Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word.
M-DEL -- Kill from the cursor to the start of the previous word, or if between words, to the start of the previous word.
C-w -- Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace. This is different than M-DEL because the word boundaries differ.
C-p -- Move `up' through the history list.
C-n -- Move `down' through the history list.
M-< -- Move to the first line in the history.
M-> -- Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line you are entering!
C-r -- Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up' through the history as necessary. This is an incremental search.
